Features:
 * Over 3000 footprints.
 * Easy to use, generate one footprint in few seconds
   (include all necessary padstacks/shapes/flashes/devices file).
 * If you cann't find the match one, add a new one within 1 minute.
 * Program is very small (<1MB), but the footprints may be HUGE.
 * Multilanguage support.
 * IPC-7351A name-convention for most of the SMD footprints.
 * Customized footprint(through skill file).
 * Many parameters configurable.
 * Windows GUI.
 * Totally free.

  .Customized symbols will append only if skill file exist.(Uri Chaplin).
  .A little bit rich contexts in silkscreen/assembly layer.
  .Add some utilities (test under allegro 15.5, custom FPM menu,skills)
  .Better format of customize skill file.
  .Include more skill files(USB,miniPCI,etc.).
  .Pads for QFN,SON change from oblong to fillet-rectangle. (schuang333)
  .Bug-fixed: TH pad, thermal pad ID/OD problem. (Evayao).
  .Bug fixed: Pads in some components are not present.
  .Add small circle for centroid marker. (Nathan)
  .All fields are sortable.
  .Internal function updated(for support gold finger pad)

  .English version.(sorry for my not-properly English language)
  .All DFA-bound support (Allegro version must be 15.5+)
  .Some Pin2Pin bugs fixed(in some case)(SOP,SON,QFP,etc.)
  .Better silk outline
  .Sortable columes(click the colum head).
  
0.06:  2006-8-30
  .Add over 1000 BGA/LGA (finally I done these part:)
  .Minor change for SKILL and GUI
  .Over 5000 footprint
  ."batch generate" mode move to menu
   (due to the number of footprint, we rarely use this mode)
  .Add more skill examples.
  .Copy/paste/cut for other application
   (such as OrCAD capture CIS database)
  .Support multiple selection in grid
  to-do list:
  * DFA-bound support (Allegro version must be 15.5+)
  * More connector implement( USB, FPC, PCI-EXPRESS etc.)
  * Multilanguage support( any volunteer? please contact with me.)
  * Little forum for this FPM (http://richardlc.ifastnet.com/bbs)

  .Emergency bug-fixed:
   * Some TH footprint has no pad.
   * TestPad name error
   * Normal Thermal pad error(disabled temporally)
  others:
  .Mouse-right-click popup menu.
  .TH-DIP can change size for the padstack
  .Protrusion configuration.(under testing)

0.05:  2006-6-2
  .To make file-management easy, put every file in one directory.
  .Some parameters now are changeable
   (be careful, you may have HUGE files if enable some options)
  .TH pad use Advanced-thermal type now
  .Again, some bug fixed(file-size, Anti-Size...)
  .Finally add more footprint( rubber keypad, customized footprint)
  .Move some skill file open-source (under \skill subdirectory)
  .You may add your own skill file for your footprint(see examples)
  .For better performance, shape/flash inside the footprint will not 
  .Have .dra file, but you still can get that when extract from .brd file
  to-do list:
  * More context in help file
  * Maybe will add some print feature(maybe not)

  .Footprint are over 2000
  .Data's structure change a lot. have to re-write skill file again.:(
  .Some feature still not enable(generate device file, change SilkWidth etc.)
  .You can Add/Modify/Delete record now.
  .Name-convention more like finished
  .Better with some SMD and connector(oscillator, chip-array, NPTH, MELF...)
  .Add customized type footprint (to generate your own footprint)
  .Help file still not done due to time problem:(
  .Mounting hole with 8 vias has no DRC error in .brd file
  to-do list:
  * Continue add new footprint.(connector, keypad, PCB-antenna etc.)
  * Establish a way to "share data"
  * Hope to finish the help file.:(

0.03:  2006-4-01
  .Almost rewrite whole skill files!
  .Fix many bugs
  .Add some pictures for regular footprint.
  .Part of the function still not opened.
  .Better tree-view
  .Name-convention, meaning of "level"
  to-do list:
  * Hope to find more database for new footprint.
  * Thinking about add more footprints(connector, mounting hole, keypad, etc.)
  * Add help file.

0.02:  2006-3-26
  .Add more footprints
  .Re-arrange some footprints group/set.
  .You may delete footprint(mouse-right-click), but can't undo after you do that.
  .Note for the descriptions, you may find some other name there.
  .Add name-convention for some footprints

0.01:  2006-3-18
